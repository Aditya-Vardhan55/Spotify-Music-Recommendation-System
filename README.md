# Spotify-Music-Recommendation-System🎵
## Overview 
The Spotify Music Recommendation System is an AI-powered project that suggests songs based on user preferences. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze audio features and recommend tracks that align with individual tastes.
## Features🚀
🎼 Personalized Song Recommendations based on user input

📊 Machine Learning Model trained on Spotify's dataset

🔍 Audio Feature Analysis (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability, etc.)

🌍 User-Friendly Interface for seamless interaction

🎧 Integration with Spotify API for real-time data fetching (if applicable)
## Tech Stack🛠️
Python (for data processing & ML model)

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn (data analysis & ML)

Flask/Streamlit (for the web interface)

Spotify API (for fetching song data)

Jupyter Notebook (for model training & evaluation)
## How it Works⚙️
Data Collection: Extracts song data using Spotify API or preloaded datasets.

Feature Extraction: Analyzes key attributes like tempo, energy, etc.

Model Training: Uses ML algorithms (e.g., KNN, Collaborative Filtering) to learn user preferences.

Recommendation Generation: Suggests songs similar to the user's input.

Web Interface: Allows users to interact with the recommendation system easily.
## Dataset📂
Used Spotify dataset (Spotify million songs) from Kaggle / Spotify API.

Contains features such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.
